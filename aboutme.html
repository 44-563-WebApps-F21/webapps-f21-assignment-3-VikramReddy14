    <p>A hero is a person who is admired or idealized for courage, outstanding achievements, or noble qualities.
        Most if not every person has their own hero, whether it be a celebrity, a family member, or some random person
        who you admire.
        My hero is someone who means the world to me and that is my mom. My mom is my hero, my idol, my model figure, my
        everything.
        I define my mom as a hero because she has provided me with guidance, motherly love, and has always been there
        for me.
        She has also supported me in every way possible. My mom is someone in my life that gives me a reason to live for
        and never give up.
        First of all, my mom is my hero because she has given me guidance and advice when I needed it the most.
